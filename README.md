### Features
- Free game with no ads
- Multiplayer game
- PWA and responsive design

### Limitation
Currently I set quotas per day so the cost to run this game can't get too high. 
If the map doesn't load, it means the quotas has been exceeded on the day. 
It will reset at midnight Pacific Time. 
Sorry for inconvenience. 

### Implementation
- Google Maps API
- Firebase Realtime Database

### Contact
Feel free to give me a feedback. I would appreciate a bug report. 
Also I'm looking for sponsors to maintain this game and make this game unlimited.
