Open source geoguess game

https://geoguessmaster.net/

## Features and Highlights
- Free and no ads
- Multiplayer game in real time
- Probably the first geoguess game which implemented multiplayer mode (Even the official didn't have the feature back then)
- PWA (Mobile friendly)

## Implementation
Vue.js, TypeScript, SCSS, Firebase Realtime Database

## Limitations
I am setting a daily quota to show Google Maps and Street View so I can use Google APIs in a free tier. If you see the map color reverted, it means the daily quota has already been exceeded. If you want to avoid this, you could build this project on your local. Please try the setup guide below.

## Build Setups
You can build this project and even customize it on your local. Here is the [instruction](../master/docs/SetupLocal.md) to build this project on your local.
If you want to deploy your own game server, see [this](../master/docs/Setup.md).
