# GeoguessMaster
Open source geoguess game.

https://geoguessmaster.net/

## Features and Highlights
- Free
- Multiplayer game in real time
- Filter maps by a specific country (For now Japan is the only option because other regions cannot be filtered accurately.)
- PWA

## Implementation
Vue.js, TypeScript, SCSS, Firebase Realtime Database

## Limitations
I am setting a daily quota to show Google Maps and Street View so I can use Google APIs in a free tier. If you see the map color reverted, it means the daily quota has already been exceeded. If you want to avoid this, you could build this project on your local. Please try the setup guide below.

## Build Setups
You can build this project and even customize it on your local. Here is the [instruction](../master/docs/SetupLocal.md) to build this project on your local.
If you want to deploy your own game server, see [this](../master/docs/Setup.md).
