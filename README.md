# Geoguess Master
Geoguess Master is an open source geoguess game.

https://geoguessmaster.net/

## Limitations
This game is completely for free but there is a limitation. I am setting a quota to show Google Maps and Street Views per day because the cost gets really expensive once after exceeding the amount I can use for free in a month.  
If you see the map color reverted, it means the quota on the day has already been exceeded.

## Build Setups
Even though there is a limitation on this game, you can build your own game and even customize this game because this game is open source. Here is the [instruction](../master/docs/Setup.md). If you want to run this project on local, see this [instruction](../master/docs/SetupLocal.md).

## Features
- Free
- Multiplayer game using realtime database
- Filter Maps by a specific country.   
(There are a few countries you can select for now. But I will consider adding more as the request comes.)
- Responsive design and PWA
